# Unit Converter

This program is a simple unit converter. The design is adapted from a design-file provided by Scrimba at https://scrimba.com/links/solo-project-unit-converter-figma

The CSS layout utilizes a technique using viewport units (vh, vw) which keeps the aspect ratio of the UI regardless of the window size and scales to fit the window, like some banner ads.

Be aware that this program uses linked google fonts.
